# LiveVigor!

 LiveVigor! is a simple to use app that lets you create a profile, add exercises, and track food and calories you've entered. The other section is a BMR calculator for a general idea of your calorie needs(always check with your doctor first of course)

**Technologies Used:**

React, Mongoose, MongoDB, CSS, JWT/Bcrypt, Node


**Getting Started:**

To get started can click the link below to go straight to the app or if you want to use on your own Github links below.

(https://livevigor-frontend-6278c1ae18c8.herokuapp.com/)


GitHub link: https://github.com/WarrenWittcop/project3--backend

GitHub link: https://github.com/WarrenWittcop/project3-frontend

1.) To use the GitHub links download them onto your terminal using a Git Pull command, recommend using the same folder to house both and frontend.

2.) Once they are down use npm i to install any dependencies and update any that need it.

3.) Use the .env file to put your mongoDB or other database server info there, you would need to update this in the backend.

4.) Use your terminal, I used GitBash, to start the backend using npm start, then do the same in the frontend.

5.) React should cause your browser to open one you us npm start in the frontend, so click signup to make your own user.

6.) After a user is made use your user name/email and password to login. In the future you just click login unless you want to make a new user.

7.) Once logged in you start on the profile screen. You can update any of your info listed by hitting edit. Once done editing click save if you want to keep them or cancel to get rid of the changes.

8.) You can use the navbar at the top to go to either Nutrition, Exercise, or BMR. Nutrition and Exercise function the same way as the profile.

9.) BMR is a link for a calorie calculator that does not require log in. You just fill the fields as listed and then click Calculate BMR for the result.


**Next Steps:**

-Make it so nutrtition and exercise are savable and reviewable by date

-Allow push notifications for log reminders

-Allow color scheme changing
